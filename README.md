Problem Statement:

The grocery store is struggling with price fluctuations and shelf-life management of perishable goods. Predicting price changes and estimating shelf life accurately is crucial to optimizing inventory and reducing waste. Currently, the shop lacks a data-driven approach to understanding how factors like storage conditions, quality, and time in inventory affect product pricing and longevity.

To address this, a machine learning-based solution is being developed to analyze historical grocery data and predict:

Future price trends based on storage conditions and product attributes.

Shelf life estimation to improve stock management and reduce spoilage.

This solution aims to enhance inventory decision-making, minimize losses, and increase profitability through predictive analytics.
